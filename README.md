This repository is a storage location for my coding problem solutions. It can range from Leetcode to Kattis to any coding sites. 

In 2020, I first began experimentation with programming using C and LUA. Ever since then, it has evolved into a major hobby of mine due to the satisfaction I feel when solving problems with a team that give me an great feeling of reward due to solving a difficult problem. To display my skill in logic-based coding problems, I have decided to create a hub for my achievements across many programming languages.
